- Everything happens for a reason
- Have the will to take risks
- The best way to learn is by doing
- You are never owed anything by anyone, so don't expect anything
- Put yourself in situations to be in the right place at the right time
- Seek discomfort (as clich√© as this sounds - shoutout yestheory)
- Self-doubt is the enemy of progress: the second you stop believing in yourself the battle has already been lost because if you don't have conviction in yourself, there is no point in doing things
- **Keep going**
- The greatest things are those that can compound
- Work with people you believe in
- Anxiety comes from knowing you can be doing better, and inaction is what leads to that situation, so just keep going
- Working with great people makes it much better
- Surround yourself with those who are better than you
- Things don't need to be done perfectly; they just need to be done quickly: perfection is a zero-sum game, so it's more important to get things done and iterate. This can apply to anything from building prototypes to taking notes in a textbook
- Communication is more important than anything: miscommunication is the core of most problems. This is an easy fix: communicate clearly and concisely
- Comparison is the thief of joy, because the grass is always greener on the other side: focus on watering your own grass and become busy enough to not compare to others
- Don't take anything for granted
