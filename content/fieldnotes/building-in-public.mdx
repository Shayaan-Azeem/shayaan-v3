# Building in Public

Today I decided to start sharing more of my journey publicly. This fieldnotes system is part of that commitment.

## Why Now?

For years, I've been building things quietly. TensorForest, Apocalypse Hacks, various side projectsâ€”most of the process happened behind closed doors. But I'm realizing there's value in sharing the journey, not just the outcomes.

## What I'll Share

- **Process over polish**: Raw thoughts and works-in-progress
- **Failures and learnings**: What doesn't work is as interesting as what does
- **Behind the scenes**: The messy, iterative reality of building
- **Community connections**: Meeting others on similar journeys

## The Tools

This simple content management system is perfect for this approach:

- Write in Obsidian (my favorite note-taking app)
- Commit with Git (version control for thoughts)
- Auto-deploy with Vercel (share instantly)

No complex CMS, no paid platforms, just simple tooling that gets out of the way.

## Come Along

If you're building something, I'd love to connect. Let's share the journey together.
