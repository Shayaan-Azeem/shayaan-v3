# Welcome to Fieldnotes

This is my first fieldnote using the new content management system. I'm testing how MDX works with our setup.

## Why Fieldnotes?

I wanted a place to capture shorter thoughts, observations, and learnings from my journey. Unlike longer writings, fieldnotes are meant to be:

- **Quick captures** of ideas
- **Observations** from daily work
- **Learnings** that might be useful later
- **Reflections** on projects and experiences

## Testing Features

Let me test some MDX features:

### Code Blocks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!"
console.log(greeting)
```

### Lists

- Building things is fun
- Learning in public helps others
- Iteration beats perfection

### Links

Check out my [main site](/) or my [projects](/projects).

This is just the beginning. More fieldnotes to come as I continue building and learning.
