# On Building Things

There's something magical about bringing ideas to life. Whether it's code, hardware, or organizing events, the process of building teaches you more than any classroom ever could.

## The Iterative Nature of Creation

Looking back at my journey—from selling slime at 11 to organizing Canada's largest high school hackathon—each project taught me something different:

### Early Experiments

- **Slime business**: Taught me about supply, demand, and margins
- **Video editing**: Showed me the power of storytelling
- **YouTube channel**: Revealed the importance of consistency
- **Crypto trading**: Introduced me to risk and volatility

### Scaling Up

As I got older, the projects became more complex:

- **TensorForest**: Combined hardware, AI, and environmental impact
- **Apocalypse Hacks**: Required fundraising, logistics, and community building
- **Hack Club work**: Taught me about content strategy and audience growth

## What I've Learned

Through all these projects, a few principles have emerged:

### 1. Start Before You're Ready

> "if you're going to try, go all the way" - Charles Bukowski

Every project I've started felt too big for me at the time. But that's exactly when you learn the most. TensorForest taught me about drones, AI, and climate science. Apocalypse Hacks taught me about event management, sponsorship, and community building.

### 2. Embrace Failure as Data

Not every project succeeds. My dropshipping venture made one sale and lost money. But failure teaches you what doesn't work, which is just as valuable as knowing what does.

### 3. Find Your People

The best projects happen when you find others who share your vision. The Apocalypse Hacks team made that event possible. The TensorForest project connected me with mentors and collaborators.

## Looking Forward

I'm still building, still learning, still iterating. The tools change, the scale changes, but the fundamental joy of creation remains the same.

Whether you're 11 selling slime or 18 organizing hackathons, the important thing is to start. To try. To build something that matters to you.
