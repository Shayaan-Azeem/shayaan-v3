a few weeks ago, me and my friend were have a late night conversation that was quite deep lol, the premise being the idea of regretting things, he asked me if I had any regrets from high school and at the time quite frustrated with m y circumstances, situation and awaiting university decisions, I gave a him a huge list of things id do differently, but he heard me , took a pause and promptly replied to me saying that if those things had happend or been done differently you wouldn’t be the same person you are today, you wouldn’t have the same experiences, you wouldn’t have done the thing that make you so much of who you are 

i hadn’t realized this, but he was right, if things had gone the way I wanted then I wouldn’t even be me today, and if I’m being honest I wouldn’t trade anything for the experiences who have made me who I am today… 

a week or so after this, I was speaking to another friend who asked me the same thing, he was younger than me so he asked? What would you differently if you could go back? If you were in my shoes what would you do differently from what you did? 

This time around though my answer was nothing, I wouldn’t do anything differently, I would trade it for anything, because to be quite honest I don’t have any regrets, I understand that everything happens for a reason and you just need to have faith in that

this realization reminded me of the Kanye lyric “everything I’m not made me everything i am”
