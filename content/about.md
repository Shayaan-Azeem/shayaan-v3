## intro

i'm 18 years old, from toronto, and i like building things.

incoming student studying applied math and ml at [hover-1] [@uwaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

## lately i've been:
- building a community for cracked/ambitious teenagers building cool sh*t
## some cool things i've done in the past:

- spent a year building autonomous drones to predict forest fires  
  [backed by [hover-2] [bloomberg philanthropies](https://www.bloomberg.org/government-innovation/spurring-innovation-in-cities/youth-climate-action-fund/)] [[hover-3] [offered $250k preseed](https://www.joinef.com/)]
- worked as a growth intern at [hover-4] [hack club](https://hackclub.com/), grew [hover-5] [@starthackclub](https://www.instagram.com/starthackclub/) to 100k followers
- organized [hover-6] [canada's largest high school hackathon](https://apocalypse.hackclub.com/), raised $50k
- founded [hover-7] [robotics club](https://wossrobotics.ca/) at my hs, ranked top 62 in the world
- won bronze [3rd place] at the [hover-8] [canadian world robot olympiad](https://wro-association.org/).

## how i started:

i've always been really creative, and a builder at heart, from a young age always wanted to sell things tried to become an entrepreneur with everything

- at 13 i was doing freelance video editing and design on upwork and fiverr (got banned from upwork for being underage)
- also at 13 i started a tech review youtube channel (hit 50k views 500 subs and got into twitter but lowkey gave up too early) {this taught me perfection is the enemy of..}
- at 14 i made my first $10k from crypto
- at 15 i launched my first venture dropshipping fingerprint padlocks (made one sale net loss ðŸ˜­)

## where do i see myself in 10 years:

probably still building in tech, maybe in a niche like environmental or health tech. i'm not exactly sure where i'll end up, but i know i want to be creating products that make a real positive impact on people's lives. i might also be involved in venture capital, supporting other builders. and i hope i'm still fostering community and creating spaces for curious likeminded people to connect.
